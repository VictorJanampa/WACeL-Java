# WACeL-Java
# Automated Analysis of Natural Language Requirements: Scenarios &amp; Lexicons Tool

C&L is a web application (Java, MySql) for editing, visualization and analysis of scenarios. C&L architecture is based on layers style, divided into modules and developed using Domain-driven Design practices. Modules group functionalities to manage users (User), projects (Project), lexicon symbols (Language used in the application - LEL), scenarios (Scenario) and to perform Analysis. The input of the C&L is composed of projects containing scenarios in plain text format. The output is a set of formatted scenarios, where the relationships among scenarios are represented by hyperlinks (It facilitates the navigation between scenarios). Other outputs include: (1) A Petri-Net representing the scenarios and their relationships and (2) a Feedback with detailed information about scenarios analysis.

Scenarios are often described using templates based on Cockburn [1] or scenario language proposed by Leite et al. [2].

## Build Instructions

Here are some helpful instructions to use the latest code:

### Build with Eclipse and Maven

1. Make sure you have MySql installed, details here:
    [https://www.mysql.com/downloads/](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
2. Create MySql schema "celdb" with user "root" and password "admin"     (change!)

3. Make sure you have Apache Tomcat installed, details here:
    [https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi)  --> Stop tomcat service
     
4. Make sure you have Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers, details here:     [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
 
5. Eclipse IDE: Import as maven project (clone!)

6.  Eclipse IDE: Run as -> Maven build -> clean install

7. Eclipse IDE: Run as -> Run on server

8. Initialize (test user and profiles) "celdb": [initialize.sql](https://github.com/edgarsc22/WACeL-Java/blob/master/sqlscript/initialize.sql)

9. Initialize projects from Case Studies (projects and scenarios) in "celdb":  [case_study_projects.sql](https://github.com/edgarsc22/WACeL-Java/blob/master/sqlscript/case_study_projects.sql)

 10. go to http://localhost:8080/WACeL-Java and Test with user "test" and password "123456" (change!)

##  Case Studies
  There are some real **projects** in the literature, and as a result, we selected 4 projects to evaluate the _accuracy_ of the heuristics implemented in the C&L tool:      [Case Studies](https://github.com/edgarsc22/WACeL-Java/blob/master/docs/CeL%20and%20Case%20Study.pdf)
